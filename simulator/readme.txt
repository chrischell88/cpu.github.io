Central Process Unit (CPU) scheduling deals with having more processes/threads than processors to handles those tasks, 
meaning how the CPU determines which jobs it is going to handle in what order. A good understanding of how a CPU scheduling
algorithm works is essential to understanding how an Operating System works; a good algorithm will optimally allocate resources, 
allowing an efficient execution of all running programs. A poor algorithm, however, could result in any number of issues, 
from process being "starved out¡± to inefficient executing, resulting in poor computer performance.




Instructions
To begin, 
1) Select the type of algorithms. 
2) Enter the number of process to be simulate. (1-10)
3) Enter the simulation running time in miliseconds 1-3000.(1 miliseconds is the fastest) 
4) Click "Simulate" button to run the algorithms.
5) Enter the data for the processes (start time and need time). 
5a) If Round Robin algorithm selected, enter the number of quantum counter. (1-10) 
6) Click "Run" button to view the result.
6a) To view the current Gantt chart result again, click the "Simulate" button.
7) To run other algorithms, repeat the step 1-6.
